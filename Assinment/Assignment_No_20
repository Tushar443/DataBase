3)==> Some SQL implementations have a built-in constant representing the current date,
   sometimes called CURDATE or SYSDATE. The word SYSDATE can
   therefore be used in a SQL statement, and be replaced by the current date when the
   value is accessed by commands such as Select or Insert. We will use a view of the
   Orders table called Entryorders to insert rows into the Orders table. Create the
   Orders table, so that SYSDATE is automatically inserted for odate if no value is
   given. Then create the Entryorders view so that no values can be given.
